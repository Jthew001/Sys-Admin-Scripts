# Sys-Admin-Scripts
Scripts I have collected/written for use as Sys Admin. Free to use. 

I will slowly update the scripts as I use them, documentation is best effort at this point. 

I plan to update my Powershell scripts with MgGraph modules in the future, as it stands, MgGraph doesn't work as well as expected for what I need it for at the moment. 

I am also NSE 4 certificate with FortiNet, but have yet to have the need to write FortiCli scripts, but I will add them once I get there.
